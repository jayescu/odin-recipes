My current project is to create a website for accessing and searching recipes. I hope this will be the best recipe website on the internet, I will accept nothing less.

In order to complete this monumental task, I will use Github to create a repository, which I'll then clone to my machine. I'll write the HTML code through VSCode, and then add my commits and push them to Github.

I will create an index page that will lead to my recipe pages. I can't say this enough, it'll be the best recipe site on the whole internet. All of it.
