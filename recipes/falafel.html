    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried chickpeas (soaked overnight)</li>
        <li>1 small onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the mix: Drain the soaked chickpeas. Add them to a food processor with onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro (if using), cumin, coriander, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Blend until a coarse, crumbly mixture forms. It should hold together when pressed.</li>
        <li>Chill the mixture: Cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to firm up.</li>
        <li>Shape the falafels: Roll the mixture into small balls or flatten slightly into patties.</li>
        <li>Cook: Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Fry falafels until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve: Drain on paper towels and serve warm with pita, hummus, or salad.</li>
    </ol>
