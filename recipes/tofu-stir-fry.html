        <li>Prepare the tofu: Press the tofu to remove excess water, then cut it into cubes.</li>
        <li>Cook the tofu: Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the tofu cubes and cook until golden and crispy on all sides (about 8-10 minutes). Remove tofu from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté the vegetables: In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir-fry the bell peppers, broccoli, and carrots for about 5 minutes until they are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl, mix 2-3 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, and 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (if using). Add the garlic (and ginger, if using).</li>
        <li>Combine and serve: Add the cooked tofu back into the pan with the vegetables. Pour the sauce over and stir everything together. Cook for another 2 minutes. Serve over rice or noodles and enjoy!</li>
